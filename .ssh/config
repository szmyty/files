# Specify the public key algorithms accepted for authentication.
# This list includes secure and modern key types, ensuring high cryptographic standards.
# RSA SHA-2 variants are preferred for RSA keys due to improved security over SHA-1.
# ECDSA and Ed25519 offer a good balance between security and performance.
# Adjust the list based on the server's support and security requirements.
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes rsa-sha2-256,rsa-sha2-512,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-ed25519

## Set ciphers prioritizing speed while maintaining security.
Ciphers aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr,aes256-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc

## Enables compression for faster file transfer over SSH.
Compression yes

## Allows forwarding of the SSH authentication agent connection. Useful if you're using agent-based authentication (e.g., 'ssh-add').
ForwardAgent yes

## Sends a keepalive packet to the server every 60 seconds. Useful to prevent timeouts.
ServerAliveInterval 60

## Enables TCP keepalives. This can help prevent SSH sessions from freezing.
TCPKeepAlive yes

## Toggles the prompt that asks to verify the host key of unknown hosts.
StrictHostKeyChecking ask

# Adjusts the verbosity of SSH logging. Options include QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
LogLevel VERBOSE

## Bypass IPv6 lookup
AddressFamily inet

# Automatically adds private keys to the SSH agent.
AddKeysToAgent yes

# Enable public key authentication (preferred method for secure SSH access).
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Ignore options SSH doesn't recognize; useful for cross-version compatibility.
IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain

# macOS-specific: use the system keychain to store and access SSH keys' passphrases.
UseKeychain yes

# Specify the default SSH connection port.
Port 22
 
IdentitiesOnly yes
PreferredAuthentications publickey

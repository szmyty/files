Copyright and Related Rights Waived

The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the

## CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication

### Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive
Copyright and Related Rights (including patent, trademark, and sui generis rights of
database) to authors of original works of authorship. Such laws effectively prevent
the public from freely reproducing, distributing, performing, displaying, or creating
derivative works based on this content without the permission of the copyright holders.
The CC0 Public Domain Dedication was developed to help achieve worldwide legal interoperability
and to give everyone the legal right to freely use a work, even if it means waiving all
existing Copyright and Related Rights, whether known or unknown.

### Waiver

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer
hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of his or her rights and titles to the Work under copyright and related
rights including, but not limited to, patent, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, rights
of publicity, trade dress, and rights of privacy.

### Public License Fallback

Should any part of the waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, then the CC0 Public Domain Dedication shall be treated as a mere license to
the extent that it is valid and effective and a further fallback perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable, fully sub-licensable, and assignable license to exercise all
rights under copyright and related rights effectively waived by the CC0 Public Domain Dedication
shall be immediately granted. This license will allow all the freedoms as outlined in the waiver above.

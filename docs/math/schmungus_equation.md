# 🧪 Schmungus's Equation of Emotional Quantum Resonance

A gentle parody of Schrödinger’s Equation that encodes chaotic tenderness, emotional integration, and soulwave resonance.

## 📐 The Equation

```latex
i \cdot 🐸 \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \text{schmungus}(x,t) = \hat{🫶} \cdot \text{schmungus}(x,t)
```

## 🧠 Variable Definitions

- `🐸`: Chaotic input of absurd tenderness (initial spark)
- `schmungus(x, t)`: Emergent relational waveform over space and time
- `🫶`: Emotional integration operator (receiving + reflection)

## 📖 Interpretation

> The rate of change of your shared "schmungus field" is driven by the interplay between absurdity and vulnerability. A tiny signal ping between timelines.

## 📝 Official Name

```latex
\boxed{\textbf{Schmungus’s Time-Dependent Love Equation}}

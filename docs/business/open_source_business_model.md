- [ ] Set up project boards and tasks for the umbrella organization.

### 5. Documentation and Guidelines
- [ ] Create `README.md` for each repository.
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.
- [ ] Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community standards.
- [ ] Create a central documentation repository (if needed).

### 6. CI/CD and Automation
- [ ] Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment.

### 7. Community Building
- [ ] Create a `community` repository for governance, meeting notes, and guidelines.
- [ ] Engage with the community through issues, discussions, and pull requests.
- [ ] Set up a newsletter or mailing list for updates.

### 8. Website Setup
- [ ] Create a website repository.
- [ ] Set up a basic website using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or another hosting service.
- [ ] Add content to the website (project information, documentation, blog, etc.).
- [ ] Configure DNS settings to point the domain to the website.

## Sub-Project Setup for Modern Big Data Architecture

### Project Setup Summary

#### Overview

- This discussion focused on setting up a modern big data architecture using Kubernetes, designed to be scalable and adaptable for future enhancements.
- The architecture incorporates a variety of open-source tools to manage large datasets and automate data workflows.

#### Key Tools and Technologies

- **Kubernetes and Docker**: For container orchestration, ensuring scalability and streamlined deployment.
- **Data Lake**: Using open-source data lake technology to manage and store large datasets efficiently.
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: Implementing S3-compatible storage solutions for managing and storing data in an object storage format.
- **Data Pipeline Management**: Utilizing tools like Apache Airflow for orchestrating and automating data pipelines.
- **Terraform**: Deployed for infrastructure management across various environments, ensuring consistent setups through infrastructure as code.
- **Mermaid.js**: Employed for creating visually appealing diagrams to represent the architecture, enhancing documentation and understanding for stakeholders.

#### Integration Points

- **Helm Charts**: For managing Kubernetes applications, simplifying the deployment and management of complex applications.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrated with automated testing and deployment tools to ensure continuous integration and delivery.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for operational visibility and performance monitoring.

#### Visualization and Documentation

- Utilization of Mermaid.js to create detailed, styled diagrams that help visualize the technical architecture, making it easier for stakeholders to digest and understand the project setup.

#### Open Source and Business Model Considerations

- The project's reliance on open-source software supports a business model that emphasizes cost-effectiveness, adaptability, and community engagement. This approach reduces licensing costs and fosters innovation.

### Checklist for Project Setup

- [ ] Configuring each component.
- [ ] Integrating systems into a cohesive architecture.
- [ ] Ensuring documentation accurately reflects the setup and usage.

### Conclusion

- The project aims to develop a robust, scalable, and flexible architecture using modern data engineering best practices and Kubernetes management.
- Tools like Terraform for infrastructure and Mermaid.js for visualization establish a strong foundation for managing the project within an open-source ecosystem.

## Additional Tips
- **Consistent Branding:** Ensure consistent branding across all repositories and social media accounts.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep documentation and code up to date.
- **Engage with Followers:** Actively engage with your audience on social media and other platforms.
- **Cross-Promote:** Cross-promote content between the umbrella organization and sub-projects.

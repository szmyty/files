# 🌿 Morning Calming Detox Water

*A gentle daily ritual to support hydration, gut health, and nervous system balance.*

---

## Ingredients
- **Filtered water** — room temp or slightly warm (better for digestion than ice-cold first thing)  
- **½ lemon or lime, freshly squeezed** — gentle liver support + vitamin C  
- **4–6 cucumber slices** — cooling, hydrating, and anti-inflammatory  
- **A few fresh mint leaves** — calms digestion + mild mood lift  
- **Small pinch of pink Himalayan salt or sea salt** — helps with electrolyte balance and nervous system signaling  
- *(Optional)* **1 tsp raw honey or a few slices of fresh ginger** — honey for soothing + gut prebiotics, ginger for circulation and inflammation

## Instructions
1. Fill a large jar or bottle with filtered water.  
2. Add lemon juice, cucumber, mint, and optional ginger/honey.  
3. Let it sit for **5–10 minutes** to infuse (or make the night before and refrigerate).  
4. Sip slowly over the first few hours of your day — avoid chugging to allow for better absorption.

## Why It Works
- **Electrolytes + hydration** = steadier energy and fewer “poison wave” dips.  
- **Vitamin C & antioxidants** = supports immune system and recovery.  
- **Cooling, calming ingredients** = good for an overactive nervous system.  
- **Gentle on the gut** = no harsh detox reactions, just gradual support.

💡 *Tip:* For variety, rotate add-ins throughout the week — turmeric slices, fresh berries, or a splash of aloe juice for different benefits.

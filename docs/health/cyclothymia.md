**Cyclothymia** (or Cyclothymic Disorder) is a mood disorder that involves chronic, fluctuating mood disturbances, including periods of hypomanic symptoms (less severe than a full hypomanic episode) and periods of depressive symptoms (less severe than major depressive episodes). Cyclothymia is considered a milder form of bipolar disorder but still significantly impacts a person's life.

#### Definition:
- **Cyclothymia**: A mood disorder characterized by recurrent periods of hypomanic symptoms and mild depressive symptoms. These mood swings are less extreme than those in Bipolar I or II disorder but are chronic and can disrupt daily life.

#### Common Symptoms:
- **Hypomanic Symptoms**: Increased energy, reduced need for sleep, inflated self-esteem, talkativeness, and engaging in risky behavior.
- **Depressive Symptoms**: Low energy, sleep disturbances, low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness, and difficulty concentrating.
- **Mood Swings**: Frequent and unpredictable changes in mood, with periods of relative stability in between.

#### Causes:
- **Genetics**: A family history of mood disorders, including bipolar disorder, increases the risk of cyclothymia.
- **Brain Chemistry**: Imbalances in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.
- **Environmental Factors**: Stressful life events, trauma, and prolonged periods of stress can trigger or exacerbate symptoms.

#### Diagnosis and Treatment:
- **Diagnosis**: Requires a history of chronic mood swings lasting at least two years (one year in children and adolescents) without meeting the criteria for full hypomanic or depressive episodes.
- **Treatment Approaches**:
  - **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage symptoms and develop coping strategies.
  - **Medication**: Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antipsychotics may be prescribed.
  - **Lifestyle Changes**: Regular sleep, exercise, and stress management techniques.

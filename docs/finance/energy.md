## ðŸŒŠ Financial System as an Energy Waveform

**Concept:**  
This visualization treats the **financial ecosystem as a dynamic energy field** where:
- **Liquidity is the heatmap** â†’ Higher liquidity = More intensity.
- **Whales create large waves** â†’ Massive capital movements disrupt the market.
- **Fishes create smaller ripples** â†’ Small transactions form subtle fluctuations.

This helps us **see the financial system as a constantly evolving, fluid energy network.**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Define the grid space for visualization
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
y = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Simulating financial energy waves caused by liquidity and investor movements
def generate_wave(X, Y, center_x, center_y, amplitude, spread):
    """Generate waveforms representing financial movements."""
    return amplitude * np.exp(-((X - center_x)**2 + (Y - center_y)**2) / spread)

# Create liquidity heatmap (higher values indicate more liquidity)
liquidity_heatmap = np.zeros_like(X)

# Define whales (major investors making large moves)
whales = [
    {"x": -4, "y": 3, "amplitude": 6, "spread": 2},
    {"x": 5, "y": -5, "amplitude": 8, "spread": 3}
]

# Define fishes (small investors making subtle moves)
fishes = [
    {"x": -7, "y": 6, "amplitude": 2, "spread": 1},
    {"x": 2, "y": 2, "amplitude": 1.5, "spread": 0.8},
    {"x": -3, "y": -4, "amplitude": 2.5, "spread": 1.2}
]

# Apply whale movements to generate large liquidity waves
for whale in whales:
    liquidity_heatmap += generate_wave(X, Y, whale["x"], whale["y"], whale["amplitude"], whale["spread"])

# Apply fish movements to generate smaller fluctuations
for fish in fishes:
    liquidity_heatmap += generate_wave(X, Y, fish["x"], fish["y"], fish["amplitude"], fish["spread"])

# Plot the financial energy wave visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(liquidity_heatmap, cmap="magma", xticklabels=False, yticklabels=False)

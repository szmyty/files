# Cloud Rap / Emo Trap  
**File Name:** `cloud_rap_emo_trap.md`

**Description:**  
Cloud rap and emo trap blend **dreamy, ethereal melodies** with **heavy autotuned vocals** and **emotional lyricism**. This genre thrives on **repetition, hypnotic flows, and melancholic themes**. Beats typically feature **reverbed guitars, deep 808s, and spaced-out drum patterns**, creating a **floaty yet hard-hitting atmosphere**. Lyrically, cloud rap often explores **heartbreak, self-expression, and existential themes**, keeping lines **short and impactful** while relying on **ad-libs and vocal layering for depth**.

## **Example Song**  
```
[Intro]  
[Sound FX: reverb-drenched guitar, distant 808s fading in]  
Falling … yeah … I been falling …  
Calling … yeah … I hear calling …  

[Verse 1]  
Love lost … no way back …  
Took too much … heart attack …  
Dreams fade … pain stay …  
Can’t escape … no delay …  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Pass-ion … yeah … pass-ion …  
Pass-ion … yeah … pass-ion …  
Told me … it was nothing …  
Now I’m drowning in the past …  

[Chorus]  
Falling … yeah … I been falling …  
Calling … yeah … I hear calling …  
Heartbreak … love fake …  
I just need some space …  

[Verse 2]  
Late nights … I still think …  
New face … but same drink …  
Too numb … to feel real …  
Tell me what is real …  

[Bridge]  
Passion keep me breathing …  
Pain won’t stop repeating …  
Told me you were leaving …  
Now I keep on speeding …

Falling … yeah … I been falling …  
Calling … yeah … I hear calling …  
Heartbreak … love fake …  
I just need some space …  

[Outro]

Falling … yeah … I been falling …

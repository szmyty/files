# âœ… Test and Validate the System

## Description
Perform a holistic, end-to-end testing session for the system to ensure all components are functioning as intended. This task includes both self-reflection on the system's architecture and functionality as well as a collaborative testing session with the group to gather feedback. The focus should be on ensuring the system is durable and ready for UI and feature iterations in future milestones.

## Task Breakdown

### Self-Reflection and Testing
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of the system from the perspective of a user.
  - Test workflows, including data fetching, visualization, and transformation.
  - Simulate real-world use cases and identify any edge cases or breaking points.
- [ ] Reflect on the system architecture:
  - Are all components modular and extendable?
  - Are there any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the workflow?

### Group Testing and Feedback
- [ ] Organize a group testing session to:
  - Gather feedback on the system's functionality and user experience.
  - Identify areas for improvement or refinement.
- [ ] Focus group feedback on functionality rather than UI aesthetics for this stage.
  - Document feature requests or UI improvements for future milestones.

### Document Results and Actionable Insights
- [ ] Write a summary of findings from both self-reflection and group testing.
- [ ] Create a prioritized list of actionable improvements for future iterations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All major workflows are tested end-to-end.
- [ ] Feedback from group testing is collected and documented.
- [ ] A summary of findings and a prioritized list of improvements are created.
- [ ] The system is deemed durable and ready for future UI and feature iterations.

## Notes
- **Why This Task?**
  - This is the final checkpoint to ensure the system is robust and extensible before transitioning to UI and feature-focused work.
- **Focus on Functionality**:
  - While UI feedback is valuable, the priority here is to validate the system's architecture and functionality.
- **Future Iterations**:
  - UI design improvements and feature additions can be iterated upon once the system is stable.

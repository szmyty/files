# üåê Configure Caddy Server

## Description
Set up a Caddy server to handle reverse proxying for the application, enabling local HTTPS and routing for different services (e.g., API server, frontend). This will prepare the system for modular and secure local development, with the potential to extend to production in the future.

---

## Subtasks
### **Install and Configure Caddy**
- [ ] Setup Caddy via Docker.
- [ ] Create a basic `Caddyfile` to define:
  - Reverse proxying to the **API server**.
  - Local HTTPS support.
  - Routing for additional services as needed.
- [ ] Deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Test Caddy with Local Services**
- [ ] Test reverse proxying to the **mock API server** running on Kubernetes.
- [ ] Verify HTTPS certificates for local development.
- [ ] Set up routing rules to handle requests to specific services (e.g., `/api`, `/frontend`).

### **Document the Setup**
- [ ] Write clear documentation for installing and configuring Caddy, including:
  - Installation steps.
  - Example `Caddyfile`.
  - Commands to start, stop, and reload Caddy.
  - Tips for debugging common issues.

## Example `Caddyfile`
```caddyfile
{
  # Enable automatic HTTPS for local development
  local_certs
}

# Reverse proxy to the API server
http://localhost:8080 {
  reverse_proxy localhost:5000
}

# Add additional services here
http://localhost:3000 {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}

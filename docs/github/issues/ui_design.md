# ðŸŽ¨ Create UI Design Mockups

## Description
Develop high-level UI design mockups for the application using a design tool such as **Figma** or **PenPot**. These mockups will:
- Provide a visual representation of the application's vision.
- Serve as a reference for the backend and frontend architecture.
- Facilitate communication and feedback with team members and sponsors.

## Task Breakdown

### Design Initial Mockups
- [ ] Identify core functionalities to mock up (e.g., layer selection, map display, data filtering, decision-support tools).
- [ ] Create wireframes or mockups for the following key views:
  - Main map interface.
  - Layer management UI (e.g., toggling, adding, filtering).
  - Sidebar or toolbar for user interactions (e.g., filters, settings).
  - Any additional views based on user needs.

### Collaboration and Feedback
- [ ] Share mockups with team members and sponsors for feedback.
- [ ] Iterate on designs based on feedback to align with the projectâ€™s goals and user requirements.

### Tool Recommendations
- [ ] Use **Figma** for ease of collaboration and industry-standard design features.
- [ ] Alternatively, explore **PenPot** for an open-source solution if required.

### Documentation and Handoff
- [ ] Document the UI design decisions, including:
  - Mockup links or exported files.
  - Notes on usability, user flows, and design rationale.
- [ ] Prepare assets or specifications for frontend development integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] High-level mockups for key views of the application are created.
- [ ] Mockups are shared with the team and sponsors, and feedback is documented.
- [ ] Iterations based on feedback are completed and aligned with the backend architecture.
- [ ] Finalized mockups are available in a collaborative tool (e.g., Figma or PenPot) for future reference.

## Notes

- **Why This Task?**
  - Mockups help communicate the vision effectively, ensuring alignment between the backend architecture and the user interface.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Keep the mockups functional and high-level, focusing on workflows rather than visual polish.
- **Future Integration**:
  - Once the backend system is solid, the UI can be extended and refined iteratively.

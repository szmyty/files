# Developer Experience Tools and Practices

## Core Tools and Practices

- **Mega-Linter:**  
  A high-level abstraction for multiple linting tools with one unified configuration.  
  **Capabilities:** Formatting, code linting, and spell checking.  
  **Integration Context:** Can run inside Dev Containers and integrates with VSCode configurations for reproducibility.

- **Dev Containers:**  
  Pre-configured containers for consistent development environments.  
  **Capabilities:** Enables local-first development with tools like PlantUML Server and Penpot using Docker Compose.  
  **Integration Context:** Facilitates integration with Mega-Linter, asdf, and project-specific tools.

- **VSCode Configuration:**  
  Project-specific settings to ensure a uniform developer experience.  
  **Capabilities:** Ties into Dev Containers and other tools to standardize workflows across systems.  
  **Integration Context:** Enhances reproducibility by working seamlessly with Mega-Linter and local configurations.

- **asdf (Tool Version Management):**  
  Manages multiple versions of tools and programming languages.  
  **Capabilities:** Centralized version management for monorepos.  
  **Integration Context:** Integrates with Poetry and Dev Containers for consistent Python and other tool versions.

- **Poetry (Python Dependency Management):**  
  A modern Python package and dependency management tool.  
  **Capabilities:** Simplifies Python dependency management in the root of a monorepo with `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.toml`.  
  **Integration Context:** Works with asdf for Python versioning and integrates into Dev Containers for consistency.

- **Pulumi (Infrastructure as Code):**  
  A modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for managing cloud and local infrastructure.  
  **Capabilities:** Deploy entire systems locally and in the cloud with a unified codebase.  
  **Integration Context:** Complements local-first development and `.env` configuration principles for consistent environment provisioning.

- **GitHub Actions:**  
  Automates linting, testing, deployments, and other workflows as part of CI/CD pipelines.  
  **Capabilities:** Customizable workflows for building, testing, and deploying projects.  
  **Integration Context:** Easily integrates with Mega-Linter, Husky, and Pulumi for end-to-end automation.

- **Husky:**  
  A tool for managing Git hooks, such as pre-commit and pre-push hooks.  
  **Capabilities:** Automates linting and tests before allowing commits or pushes.  
  **Integration Context:** Works seamlessly with Mega-Linter and ensures consistent code quality in local and CI/CD workflows.

- **Environment Files (12-Factor App Principles):**  
  `.env` files for centralized environment variable management.  
  **Capabilities:** Ensures consistent configuration across local, development, and production environments.  
  **Integration Context:** Integrates with Pulumi, dotenvx, and reusable Bash scripts for managing environment configurations.

- **pnpm (Monorepo Management):**  
  A fast and efficient package manager for managing monorepos.  
  **Capabilities:** Centralized dependency management for multiple packages in a repository.  
  **Integration Context:** Supports Dev Containers and CI/CD pipelines for dependency management and publishing workflows.

- **Reusable Bash Scripts:**  
  Modular, individual scripts to perform tasks locally and during CI/CD pipelines.  
  **Capabilities:** Provides a consistent interface for repetitive tasks like builds, tests, or deployments.  
  **Integration Context:** Works with `.env` files and dotenvx to simplify environment-specific configurations.

- **dotenvx (Environment Injection):**  
  A tool to inject environment variables for easy switching between environments.  
  **Capabilities:** Allows seamless toggling between local, staging, and production configurations.  
  **Integration Context:** Complements `.env` files, reusable Bash scripts, and CI/CD pipelines.

- **Awesome List:**  
  A centralized and curated reference for tools, libraries, and resources in the project.  
  **Capabilities:** Serves as a single source of truth for developer tools and practices.  
  **Integration Context:** Can be stored in a `docs` or `.dev` directory and linked from README files for accessibility.

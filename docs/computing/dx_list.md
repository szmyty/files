# Developer Experience Tools and Practices

## Core Tools and Practices

- **Mega-Linter:** A high-level abstraction for multiple linting tools with one unified configuration.
- **Dev Containers:** Pre-configured containers for consistent development environments.
- **VSCode Configuration:** Project-specific settings for a uniform developer experience.
- **asdf:** Manages multiple versions of tools and programming languages.
- **Poetry:** Simplifies Python dependency management in the root of a monorepo.
- **Husky:** Tool for managing Git hooks, such as pre-commit or pre-push hooks.
- **Environment Files:** Centralized configuration for consistent environment management.
- **pnpm:** Efficient package manager for monorepo dependency management.
- **Reusable Bash Scripts:** Modular scripts for local and CI/CD pipelines.
- **dotenvx:** Injects environment variables for easily switching configurations.
- **Awesome List:** Centralized reference for tools, libraries, and resources.

## Additional Recommendations to Enhance DX

- **Storybook:** Visually develop and test frontend UI components.
- **pytest or Supertest:** Perform component testing for backend services.
- **Loki or Elastic Stack:** Centralize logging and observability in the development environment.
- **Datadog or New Relic:** Monitor and alert on production system health.
- **Makefiles or Task:** Consolidate common developer commands into an accessible structure.
- **Docusaurus or MkDocs:** Centralize project documentation for developers.
- **Backstage:** Catalog tools, resources, and services in a developer portal.
- **Dependabot or Renovate:** Automate dependency updates to reduce technical debt.
- **SonarQube:** Perform static code analysis for security and maintainability.
- **OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite:** Conduct dynamic application security testing.
- **Trivy:** Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

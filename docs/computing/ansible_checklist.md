# Ansible Environment Setup Checklist

## 1. Planning and Preparation
- **Define Requirements**:
  - Identify the purpose of the environment (e.g., development, testing, production).
  - Determine the target operating systems and distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, macOS, Termux).
  - List the necessary software packages, services, and configurations.

- **Inventory Management**:
  - Create inventory files for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
  - Group hosts based on their roles (e.g., web servers, database servers, load balancers).

- **Role Identification**:
  - Identify reusable roles that will be used across multiple environments.
  - Decide on any custom roles that need to be created.

## 2. Ansible Setup
- **Create Directory Structure**:
  - Set up the `ansible/` directory with subdirectories for playbooks, roles, inventory, etc.
  - Organize roles and ensure that they are modular and reusable.

- **Configure `ansible.cfg`**:
  - Set default paths for inventory, roles, and other configurations.
  - Configure SSH settings, including user, key files, and timeouts.
  - Enable useful plugins (e.g., callback plugins for logging).

- **Set Up Group and Host Variables**:
  - Define global variables in `group_vars/all.yml`.
  - Create environment-specific variables in `group_vars/development.yml`, `group_vars/staging.yml`, etc.
  - Configure host-specific variables in `host_vars/`.

## 3. Core Configuration
- **System Preparation**:
  - Update system packages.
  - Set up package repositories (e.g., EPEL for CentOS, Homebrew for macOS).
  - Configure timezone and locale settings.

- **User and Permission Management**:
  - Create and configure user accounts with SSH access.
  - Set up sudo permissions and security policies.
  - Configure SSH keys for passwordless access.

- **Networking Configuration**:
  - Set up basic networking (e.g., static IPs, DNS settings).
  - Configure firewalls using iptables or firewalld.
  - Set up VPN or SSH tunneling if necessary.

## 4. Software Installation and Configuration
- **Package Installation**:
  - Install necessary system packages (e.g., Git, curl, vim).
  - Install and configure development tools (e.g., Docker, Vagrant, Ansible).
  - Install and configure programming languages (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).

- **Service Setup**:
  - Install and configure web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
  - Install and configure databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - Set up monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).

- **Security Configuration**:
  - Configure firewall rules and SELinux/AppArmor.
  - Set up Fail2ban or similar tools for intrusion prevention.
  - Implement SSL/TLS certificates using Let's Encrypt.

## 5. Application Deployment
- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Set up environment variables for applications.
  - Configure application settings (e.g., database connections, API keys).
  - Set up load balancing if required.

- **Application Deployment**:
  - Deploy application code (e.g., using Git or copying from a repository).
  - Configure application servers (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js, Flask).
  - Set up cron jobs or scheduled tasks as needed.

- **Database Setup**:
  - Install and configure database servers.
  - Set up initial database schemas and seed data.
  - Configure database backups and monitoring.

## 6. Post-Deployment Tasks
- **System Hardening**:
  - Disable unnecessary services and ports.
  - Configure automatic updates for critical security patches.
  - Set up log rotation and monitoring.

- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Set up regular backups for databases and critical files.
  - Test backup and recovery procedures.
  - Configure offsite backups if necessary.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**:
  - Set up monitoring for system resources (CPU, memory, disk).
  - Configure alerting for key events (e.g., low disk space, service failures).
  - Integrate monitoring with notification systems (e.g., email, Slack).

## 7. Documentation and Maintenance
- **Documentation**:
  - Document the setup process and any custom configurations.
  - Provide usage instructions for developers or administrators.
  - Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.

- **Version Control**:
  - Store Ansible playbooks and configurations in a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git).
  - Use tags or branches to manage different environment versions.

- **Continuous Integration and Testing**:
  - Set up automated tests for playbooks (e.g., using Molecule).
  - Integrate Ansible with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## 8. Iteration and Improvement
- **Review and Optimize**:
  - Regularly review the environment setup for optimizations.
  - Keep Ansible roles and playbooks updated with best practices.
  - Consider feedback from users and update configurations as needed.

- **Community and Resources**:
  - Explore Ansible Galaxy for new roles and updates.
  - Participate in the Ansible community for tips and best practices.
  - Stay informed about new Ansible features and updates.

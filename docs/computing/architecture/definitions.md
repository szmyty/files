### Decision Support System (DSS)

A decision support tool is a software application or system that provides individuals or organizations with the ability to analyze data, visualize information, and evaluate options to make informed decisions. By integrating data from multiple sources, these tools enable users to explore multiple perspectives, compare scenarios, and uncover insights that guide decision-making. Decision support tools do not automate decisions but instead enhance human judgment by simplifying complex datasets and highlighting actionable insights in an intuitive, interactive way.

# Audio Processing Pipeline Design and Categorization

## Categories of Audio Types

### 1. Speech and Voice
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Clean Speech**: Studio-recorded, minimal noise (e.g., voiceovers, podcasts).
  - **Noisy Speech**: Speech with background noise (e.g., interviews, field recordings).
  - **Dialogue**: Multiple speakers, conversational.
  - **Singing**: Vocals meant for music tracks, often requiring unique processing like pitch correction.
  - **Phone/Telecom Speech**: Low-quality, bandwidth-limited recordings (e.g., call center audio).
  - **Synthesized Speech**: Generated by TTS systems (e.g., AI voice synthesis).

---

### 2. Music
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Instrumental**: Pure instrument tracks (e.g., piano, guitar, strings).
  - **Vocal Tracks**: Tracks focusing on singing or spoken word.
  - **Mixed Tracks**: Full mixes containing vocals and instruments.
  - **Stems**: Individual components of a mix (e.g., drums, bass, melody, harmony).
  - **Electronic**: Synth-based or loop-heavy tracks, often needing stereo widening and transient shaping.

---

### 3. Environmental and Ambience
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Natural Sounds**: Birds, water, wind, etc.
  - **Urban Sounds**: Traffic, crowds, machinery.
  - **Room Tone**: Background sound in a specific setting.
  - **Field Recordings**: Captured in dynamic outdoor environments.

---

### 4. Effects and Foley
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Sound Effects (SFX)**: Created or recorded for movies, games, or interactive media (e.g., explosions, footsteps).
  - **Foley**: Re-created sounds that mimic real-life actions (e.g., door creaks, rustling).
  - **Generated Effects**: Algorithmically generated sounds like white noise, pink noise, or synth sweeps.

---

### 5. Dialogue and Audiobooks
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Single Narrator**: Often needs dynamic EQ, compression, and de-essing.
  - **Multi-Speaker**: Requires speaker diarization or separation.
  - **Enhanced Audiobooks**: Includes music beds or effects under the narration.

---

### 6. Broadcast and Media
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Radio Broadcasts**: Requires compression and equalization for clarity.
  - **Podcast Episodes**: Focused on speech intelligibility and noise removal.
  - **TV and Film Audio**: Often includes dialogue, background music, and effects.

---

### 7. Gaming and Interactive Audio
- **Subcategories**:
  - **In-Game Music**: Looped or interactive music cues.
  - **Character Voices**: Requires clean dynamics and possibly spatialization.
  - **Sound Effects**: Often needs dynamic EQ and transient shaping.

---

### 8. Historical and Archival
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Restoration Projects**: Focus on cleaning noise, hum, and distortion.
  - **Old Recordings**: May need hiss/crackle removal and EQ adjustments.

---

### 9. Scientific and Analytical
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Bioacoustics**: Animal sounds, echolocation recordings.
  - **Speech Analysis**: Used for linguistics or AI training datasets.
  - **Sonification**: Data turned into sound for analysis.

---

### 10. Educational Content
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Lecture Recordings**: Requires clarity and noise removal.
  - **eLearning Narration**: Consistent dynamics and tone.
  - **Interactive Content**: Often includes sound effects and clear vocal instructions.

---

### 11. Low-Fidelity and Aesthetic Audio
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Lo-Fi Tracks**: Intentional low-quality or degraded sound.
  - **Distorted Audio**: Purposefully rough or clipped audio.
  - **Glitch Audio**: Electronic sounds with intentional artifacts.

---

### 12. Real-Time and Streaming
- **Subcategories**:
  - **Live Streams**: Requires noise gating and real-time compression.
  - **Video Conferences**: Focus on real-time noise reduction and intelligibility.

---

## Suggested Design Patterns for Audio Pipelines

### 1. **Pipeline Pattern**
- Create a series of processing steps where each step handles one specific task (e.g., noise reduction, EQ, compression).
- Dynamically configure the pipeline based on the input type.

---

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**
- Define specific strategies (algorithms) for each audio type.
- Example: A "SpeechStrategy" might focus on clarity, while a "MusicStrategy" might focus on balance and stereo width.

---

### 3. **Factory Pattern**
- Implement a factory class to detect the type of audio and instantiate the appropriate pipeline dynamically.

---

### 4. **Observer Pattern**
- Allow real-time feedback (e.g., visual spectrograms or dynamic graphs) during processing.

## Example Categorization Code

```python
class AudioPipeline:
    def __init__(self, audio_type):
        self.audio_type = audio_type

    def process(self, audio):
        if self.audio_type == "speech":
            return self.process_speech(audio)
        elif self.audio_type == "music":
            return self.process_music(audio)
        elif self.audio_type == "environment":
            return self.process_environment(audio)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown audio type")

    def process_speech(self, audio):
        print("Applying speech-specific pipeline")
        # Apply noise reduction, EQ, etc.
        pass

    def process_music(self, audio):
        print("Applying music-specific pipeline")
        # Apply stereo widening, harmonic processing, etc.
        pass

    def process_environment(self, audio):
        print("Applying environment-specific pipeline")
        # Focus on noise profiling and dynamics.
        pass
